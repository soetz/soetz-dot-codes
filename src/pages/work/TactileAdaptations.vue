    <template #summary>
      <p>
        GEO is a flexible
        <abbr title="Geographic Information System">GIS</abbr> engine/app from
        Ciril Group. I spent around two weeks making sure its different
        interfaces had maximum usability on tactile and smaller devices.
      </p>
    </template>
    <template #context>
      <p>
        To be fair, GEOâ€™s interfaces werenâ€™t <em>unusable</em> in tactile
        contexts before this project. They were just not designed for it, only
        slightly adapted from their desktop counterparts, and that sometimes
        created friction and frustration on the usersâ€™ side.
      </p>

      <p>
        GEO has a lot of different interfaces and solving this issue entirely
        wouldâ€™ve involved rethinking the whole app presentation (layout,
        workflows, etc), but unfortunately we didnâ€™t have enough time to invest
        on this right away. Thatâ€™s why we split the issue in half: the quick and
        easy solutions on one side (this project), and those that needed more
        pondering on the other. I worked on defining what should this other
        sideâ€™s main concerns be, though unfortunately I couldnâ€™t implement
        anything related to it before the end of my contract.

    <template #choices>
      <p>
        Thatâ€™s why 95% of the changes made in the context of this project were
        CSS-only modifications. This part of GEO uses AngularJS so the last 5
        percents of the changes involved tweaking the templates slightly
        depending on the device. And thatâ€™s about it!

        The changes consisted in a million little tweaks so it was a pain to
        communicate with amazing product owner

        to know what his opinion about every one of them was. Thatâ€™s why we
        agreed on the general â€˜rulesâ€™ (e.g. a buttonâ€™s size must be 45 per 45
        pixels minimum) first, and then I used the browserâ€™s devtools to quickly
        demo what the result would look like so that we could discuss it
        further. This saved us a lot of back-and-forth.

    <template #lessons>
      <li>
        You must test on a real device when doing responsive work because the
        browserâ€™s â€˜responsive design modeâ€™ devtool can be misleading
      </li>
      <li>
        The devtools can be a secret weapon when you want to prototype quickly
      </li>
